📖 Bible Journey
A simple, personal tool to connect the numbers God gives you with His Word.
✨ What it does
Type a number (e.g., 507) → instantly see the scripture reference and verse text.
Supports multiple translations: KJV, ASV, FBV (switch anytime).
Displays extra study notes (Themes, Quick Reflection, Extended Reflection, Alignment, Prayer).
Add your own My Journal entries (personal themes + reflections).
Journal entries are stored locally in your browser — private to you.
Export your journal as CSV (Excel/Sheets) or JSON (backup/restore).
🌟 Anchor Verse — 507
“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”
— Psalm 51:10
This verse captures the heart of Bible Journey: every number is an invitation to renewal, reflection, and alignment with God’s Spirit.
🚀 How to use it
Notice a number (often the time God highlights to you).
Type it in the box and click Resolve.
Choose a translation (KJV / ASV / FBV).
Read the verse and study notes provided.
Record your own thoughts in My Journal.
Your journal entries stay on your device unless you export them.

❤️ Why Bible Journey?
Numbers often catch our eye — on clocks, signs, or daily life moments. Bible Journey makes it simple to connect those numbers with God’s Word, reflect personally, and carry those insights with you.

## Next steps (when you’re ready)
- Add KJV verse text (public domain) via a simple local file or API.
- Add export to `.docx` for Journal entries.
- Add sign-in & sync (Supabase) so entries follow you across devices.
- When Vercel is ready, you can deploy there too — but Pages is perfectly fine for now.

If you get stuck anywhere, ask me — I’ll walk you through it.
